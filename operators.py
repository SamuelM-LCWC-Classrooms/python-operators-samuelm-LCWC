"""
Welcome to your first assignment!

You'll see a lot going on in this file...don't worry about it for now!
Anywhere where you need to do work has been indicated with dashed lines -
write any code you need inbetween these, don't edit the existing stuff otherwise
your feedback will not work.

When you submit this to the GitHub repo, automated tests will run to check your work
If any of the tests are not passed that means you need to change something in your code!

Good luck!

If you want to run the code yourself add the name of the task as a new line at the bottom
E.g. if you want to run the code yourself for task 1 - add a new line at the bottom reading
task_1()
Or for task 4
task_4()
