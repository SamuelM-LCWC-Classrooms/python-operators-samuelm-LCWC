# Python-Operators

## Welcome to your first assignment!

You'll see a lot going on in this file...don't worry about it for now!

Anywhere where you need to do work has been indicated with dashed lines - write any code you need inbetween these, don't edit the existing stuff otherwise your feedback will not work.

When you submit this to the GitHub repo, automated tests will run to check your work. If any of the tests are not passed that means you need to change something in your code!

**Good luck!**

_**Make sure you do not edit the file test_operators.py!**_

# Task 1 - update the operation

The operation currently results in the output being False, without changing the values of the variables make it so that the code outputs True.

# Task 2 - Complete the code

Complete the code to check if the value of a is greater than b OR c, so that the result of the operation is stored in the variable result.

# Task 3 - Complete the code

Complete the code to check if the value of a is greater than b AND c, so that the result of the operation is stored in the variable result.
